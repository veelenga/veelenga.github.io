<h4>
My name is Vitalii Elenhaupt. I'm from Kiev, Ukraine. Currently I work as a Full Stack Rails Developer and actively
interested in a variety of new trending technologies and programming languages.
I feel exited when coding with style guides, git flow, code reviews and a cup of coffee.
</h4>

I have a Master's degree in Computer Science and I always believed that software development had to be my best skill.

<br/>

This is my blog, where I would share some of my thoughts (mostly technical) with others.

<br/>

I have few **hobbies** that help me to have fun and stay productive:

  * Photographing
  * Playing soccer
  * Kayaking
  * Cycling
  * Running
  * Swimming

I am glad to discuss any technical topic. Do not hesitate to contact me.
