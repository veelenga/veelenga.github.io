<h4>
My name is Vitalii Elenhaupt. I'm from Kiev, Ukraine. Currently I work as Java/Ruby Software Developer and actively interested in a variety of new trending technologies and programming languages.
</h4>

I have a Master's degree in Computer Science and I always believed that software development has to be my best skill.

<br/>

This is my blog, so here I would share some of my thoughts (mostly technical) with other people who might be interested in them.

<br/>

I have few <u>hobbies</u> that help me to have a good rest and stay productive:

  * Photographing
  * Playing soccer
  * Kayaking
  * Cycling
  * Running

Be free to contact me in case of any questions.
