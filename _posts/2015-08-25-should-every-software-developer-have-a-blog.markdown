Dear Visitor, welcome to my blog! As you may have noticed, this is my first time I am writing. So, here I decided to tell you what made me start doing this.

The idea to have a personal blog was conceived by me a year or less ago. I started to note my thoughts in hope that someday I will write down all that and share with others. My list of ideas was growing, but as usual I didn't have enough time to start blogging.

That continued until I started to read a book **"Soft Skills: The Software Developer's Life Manual"** by John Sonmez. This book is amazing, inspirational and very motivational, full of tips, ideas and experienced pieces of advice I think every Software Developer should know. That book has changed my views on the development in general and as a quick achievement I am writing this post now.

To be honest, I was a bit shocked of all the stuff described in the book I have never been thinking about. I regret that I haven't read it earlier.

There you will find how to improve your professional career, how to work from home, learn quickly, start your own business, make a good investment and much more. Should every Software Developer have a blog? Definitely, yes! Why? Just read this book, you will find an answer there.

Thanks for reading!
